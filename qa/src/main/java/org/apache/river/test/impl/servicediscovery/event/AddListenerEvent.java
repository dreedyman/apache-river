/**
 * This class verifies that bug 4712396 has been fixed. As stated in the
 * bug description: "When a ServiceDiscoveryListener is added to a lookup
 * cache, only that new listener should be notified of the existing services
 * of interest in that cache. But it appears that when a second (or third
 * or fourth, etc.) listener is added to a cache, all listeners currently
 * registered with the cache receive serviceAdded events for the services
 * of interest; even though the previously registered listeners have already
 * received the expected serviceAdded events when they were each originally
 * added to the cache."
 *
 * This test attempts to simulate the environment in which the bug described
 * above will manifest itself so as to duplicate the bug prior to a fix being
 * implemented, and to verify that the bug has indeed been fixed after the
 * intended fix has been implemented in the ServiceDiscoveryManager.
 *
 * Related bug ids: 4712396
