/** This class verifies that the <code>LookupDiscovery</code> utility
 *  monitors the multicast announcements sent from lookup services
 *  in a manner consistent with the specification. In particular, this
 *  class verifies that when the lookup discovery utility stops receiving
 *  multicast announcements from a lookup service, the lookup discovery
 *  utility will test the lookup service for reachability and, upon
 *  determining that the lookup service is indeed unreachable, will
 *  discard that lookup service.
 *
 *  Note that this class verifies only one aspect of the multicast monitoring
 *  mechanism provided by the lookup discovery utility: upon determining 
 *  that multicast announcements have ceased being received, the lookup
 *  discovery utility will test the associated lookup service for
 *  reachability; and will discard that lookup service only if that
 *  lookup service is unreachable, or no longer belongs to any of the
 *  current groups of interest.  Full verification of the multicast
 *  announcement monitoring mechanism is acheived through the combination
 *  of the lookup discovery utility test classes whose names are prefixed
 *  with 'MulticastMonitor'.
 *
 *  The environment in which this class expects to operate is as follows:
 *  <p><ul>
 *   <li> one or more lookup services, each belonging to a finite set of
 *        member groups
 *   <li> one instance of LookupDiscovery configured to discover the union
 *        of the member groups to which each lookup service belongs 
 *   <li> one DiscoveryListener registered with the lookup discovery utility
 *   <li> after discovery, the generation of multicast announcements is 
 *        stopped and each lookup service associated with those announcements
 *        is destroyed, rendering the lookup service unreachable
 *  </ul><p>
 * 
 * If the <code>LookupDiscovery</code> utility functions as specified,
 * then upon determining that mulitcast announcements are no longer being
 * received from the previously discovered lookup services, and upon
 * determining that those lookup services are unreachable, the lookup
 * discovery utility will discard each of those lookup services.
