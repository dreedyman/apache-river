/**
 * <pre>
 * Purpose:
 *   This test verifies the behavior of the constructor of
 *   AbstractConfiguration class.
 *
 * Infrastructure:
 *   This test requires the following infrastructure:
 *     1) FakeAbstractConfiguration class that implements
 *        AbstractConfiguration
 *
 * Actions:
 *   Test performs the following steps:
 *      construct a FakeAbstractConfiguration object
 *      this constructor calls AbstractConfiguration constructor
 *      assert the object is constructed and no exceptions are thrown;
 * </pre>
