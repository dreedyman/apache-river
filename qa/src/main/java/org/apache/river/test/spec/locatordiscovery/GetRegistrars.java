/**
 * This class verifies that the <code>LookupLocatorDiscovery</code> utility
 * operates in a manner consistent with the specification. In particular,
 * this class verifies that the method <code>getRegistrars</code> returns
 * an array of <code>ServiceRegistrar</code> instances in which each element
 * of the array is a proxy to one of the lookup services the lookup locator
 * discovery utility has discovered.
 *
 * The environment in which this class expects to operate is as follows:
 * <p><ul>
 *    <li> one or more lookup services, each started during construct
 *    <li> one instance of the lookup locator discovery utility
 *    <li> the lookup locator discovery utility is configured to discover the
 *         set of locators whose elements are the locators of each lookup
 *         service that was started in construct
 *    <li> one instance of DiscoveryListener registered with the lookup
 *         locator discovery utility
 * </ul><p>
 * 
 * If the lookup locator discovery utility functions as specified, then the
 * <code>getRegistrars</code> method will return an array containing the
 * same registrars as those that were started (and ultimately discovered
 * by the lookup loator discovery utility).
